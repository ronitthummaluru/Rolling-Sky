# Rolling Sky
 Created my own verision of the obstacle course game Rolling Sky


4 Obstacles were created
1. Moving vertical walls where the player must time their jumps over each wall
2. Spinning obstacles where the player must time their traversal across the platform in such a way where they get through the gaps in the obstacle
3. Logs which come towards the player and the player must avoid these logs by moving left or right (jumping is disabled for this obstacle)
4. Boulders in the sky will start falling once the player reaches this platform. Rigid bodies have been places on the falling boulders, so in addition to avoiding them falling from the sky, the player must avoid colling with moving boulders on the platform.
